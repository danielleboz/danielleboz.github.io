                <p>I started my career in Human Resources where I honed my written and verbal communication skills as well as gained a deep understanding for professionalism. It was in HR that I realized my love for technology and made a career change into IT where I excelled my tech and customer service skills.  While in IT, I realized that I had an enjoyment for coding and am looking to make another career change into Software Development.</p>

                <p>Adopt a chinchilla from South America. You can name it, feed it, give it water, play with it, bathe it, and let it use the restroom. When you interact with your chinchilla, you'll see some needs go up, while others will go down. On a scale from 0-10, your chinchilla will be happiest when their needs are at 10 and upset when their needs are at 0. Can you get all their needs to 10? Have fun!</p>

                <p>Welcome to the year 2356, where humans no longer work and every job is held by a robot. Pet shelters are no different and are run by robots. You must interact with our Pet Shelter's robot in order to play, feed, and give water to our shelter pets. You can also adopt a pet or admit a homeless pet. Each of our animals has a hunger, thirst and boredom meter (it is the future after all). Their meter is full when it reaches 100, and the pet is least happy when their needs are close to 0. Please help keep out shelter pets happy human!</p>
